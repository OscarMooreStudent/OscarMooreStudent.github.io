<p>Hi! I'll be updating this website semi-regularly with my school digital technology assignments.</p>

<p style="color:white;">Project Report 1- Unity Platformer- Oscar Moore.<br>
My objective was to create a platformer in Unity. The plan was to create a simple game using cube sprites and containing a small obstacle course that the player would jump through to complete the game’s single “level”.  I had no previous experience in Unity,<br> nor in the programming languages used in it, and saw this as a good opportunity to learn.<br> 
Objectives:<br> 
-Create a basic platformer in Unity.<br>
-Learn the basics of C++ and the Unity engine.<br>
Results:<br>
-A game that doesn’t work.<br>
-Learnt the absolute basics of the Unity engine, and a little C++.<br>
-Also learnt the value of not relying on a coding software on a 30-day free trial to code your game.<br>
Process and Planning:<br> 
I started off by trying to download a Unity tutorial for making a simple platformer, but the school firewall blocked it, along with a basic Unity toolkit for the player character’s movement. I then tried to use a tutorial I found on the Unity website,<br> but quickly ran into a number of issues in the code. I then spent most of the rest of the time allotted to me searching for a way to fix said issues, until the free trial on Visual Studio ran out and I couldn’t edit my code anymore.<br> From there, I spent the remainder of my time looking for a way to edit my code in something that isn’t Visual Studio and have so far failed.<br> 
Discussion:<br> 
I didn’t come anywhere near close to meeting my goals, unfortunately. Between the firewall stopping me from downloading Unity’s tutorials, my own incompetence when it came to puzzling out how movement and Unity’s interface worked, and Visual Studio’s trial cutting out, I accomplished next to nothing.  
In the future, I could choose a subject I have a little more experience in, or just something that’s a little less complex.
